Last.fm Basics

Last.fm is a music-tracking site. Once the user creates an account and configures their preferred music player to track their data, every song they listen to is sent to the last.fm database. Each play is referred to as a "scrobble". Last.fm uses this data to show the user their favorite music on their profile, as well as making recommendations. User data is accessible through the [last.fm API](https://www.last.fm/api).
